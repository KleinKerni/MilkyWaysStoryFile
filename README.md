# MilkyWaysStoryFile
The story file for translation and spellchecking from the game Milky ways and Bound in desire by Kerni

Do not edit the unique ID identifies and the seperators Only the text

The whole line as a abstract example : UniqueIdentifier²UsedInWhatText²TheActualTextToWrite
example:

07.05.2023 16:12:57_0²MainText²Oh.. what!

Then you only change The part "Oh.. what!" to whatever you think is right ^_^

only change the actual text to write! 
(Otherwise i am not able to insert it back into the game at the right position)
