# MilkyWaysStoryFile
The story file for translation and spellchecking from the game Milky ways and Bound in desire by Kerni

Do not edit the unique ID identifies and the seperators Only the text

The whole line as a abstract example : UniqueIdentifier²UsedInWhatText²TheActualTextToWrite
example:

07.05.2023 16:12:57_0²MainText²Oh.. what!

Then you only change The part "Oh.. what!" to whatever you think is right ^_^

If you find sentences with strings encapsulated in || signs, for example |LastUsedCharName3rdPer| , this is a variable and |LastUsedCharName3rdPer| referes to the last used 3rd person character used. (Usually Kyra the main character)

only change the actual text to write! 
(Otherwise i am not able to insert it back into the game at the right position)
